NICE Symbolic Execution for Python (Z3)

This code is a port of the NICE project's (http://code.google.com/p/nice-of/) 
symbolic execution engine for Python to use the Z3 theorem prover (http://z3.codeplex.com).
The port removes all the NICE-specific depenendences and forms the basis for
students to experiment with symbolic execution in a very small code base across
a variety of platforms:

Requirements:

- Python version 2.7
- Z3 

Setup instructions:

- TBD
